Code is good but create output_path if it doesn't exists

Your Python script looks quite comprehensive and well-organized. You have modules for working with JSON data, handling dates and times, managing file operations, and processing PDF files. You also correctly handle some error cases, such as missing directories.

I noticed one area that you specifically mentioned—ensuring the output directory exists before attempting to merge PDFs—and I see that you already have a check for that in your process_json_files function. Here’s a small refinement to ensure clarity and prevent any unnecessary folder creation unless it's needed:

    Check and Create Output Directory: Your code already checks if the output directory exists and creates it if it doesn't. However, it’s nested inside the loop that iterates over JSON files. If there are no JSON files or if all JSON files lack ExamInfos, the directory would not be created. Moving this check outside of any loop ensures the directory is created regardless of the JSON content.

Here is an adjusted version of your process_json_files function to make sure the output directory is prepared before any processing starts:

python

def process_json_files(json_files, pdf_base_path, output_path):
    # Ensure the output directory exists at the very beginning
    if not os.path.exists(output_path):
        os.makedirs(output_path)
        print(f"Created output directory {output_path}")

    proctor_pdfs = {}

    for json_file in json_files:
        data = load_json_data(json_file)
        exam_infos = data.get('ExamInfos', [])
        for exam_info in exam_infos:
            department = exam_info['Department']
            course_code = exam_info['CourseCode']
            education_type = exam_info['EducationType']
            classrooms = exam_info['Classrooms']
            proctors = exam_info['Proctors']
            exam_datetime = parse_exam_time(exam_info['ExamDay'], exam_info['ExamMonth'], exam_info['ExamYear'],
                                            exam_info['ExamHour'], exam_info['ExamMinute'])

            department_key = 'Bilgisayar' if 'Bilgisayar' in department else 'Makine'
            education_type_key = {'Gündüz': 'Örgün', 'Gece': 'Gece', 'Gündüz ve Gece': 'Ortak'}[education_type]

            for proctor, classroom in zip(proctors, classrooms):
                pdf_files = find_pdfs_for_proctor(pdf_base_path, department_key, course_code, education_type_key,
                                                  classroom, exam_datetime)
                if pdf_files:
                    if proctor not in proctor_pdfs:
                        proctor_pdfs[proctor] = []
                    proctor_pdfs[proctor].extend(pdf_files)

    for proctor, pdf_files in proctor_pdfs.items():
        merge_pdfs(output_path, proctor, pdf_files)

This slight adjustment ensures that your script is ready to process and save PDF files without running into issues where the output directory might not exist when it tries to save files. Everything else in your script is well-handled!
